Hugo combined with the Aether theme turns easy to write markdown into powerful web pages.  KaTeX, Highlight.js, and Hugo provides the ability to create mathmatical symobols, equations, highlighted code, tables, lists, and much more.

For each feature below, the first line is the markdown and the second line is the result after Hugo, KaTeX, and Highlight.js process the markdown.  You can find many more features in the Hugo documentation.
